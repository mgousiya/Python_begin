Issue - 1
 The requested URL returned error: 403
this usually happens when you configured new github account in local while exisitng one
as you have already exisintg one it takes always old PAT token even though you set new repository url
to avoid old PAT taking you need to setup new hTTPS authentication with new github account for that create NEW PAT token
of type classic give all access with No expiration

then follow with step-1

git remote set-url origin https://<your-token>@github.com/username/repository.git



# issue 2- [remote rejected] Main -> Main (push declined due to repository rule violations)
